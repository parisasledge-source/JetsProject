# Jets Project

### Description

Jets project is a project that reads from a text file and prints out the information about different jets.
The user is prompted to choose from a menu to display:
1. Detail information about the jets including their model, speed, range and price.
2. Printing out the jet details and the amount of time the jet can fly until it runs out of fuel (based on speed and range).
3. Viewing the fastest jet and printing out all of the information about the jet.
4. Viewing the longest range jet and printing out all of the information about the jet.
5. Loading all Cargo Jets
6. Staring attack on all fighter Jets
7. Adding a jet to the Fleet
8. Removing a jet from Fleet
9. Quit


### Lessons Learned

The use of extending of an abstract class and implementation of interfaces and how they pass information and values do to that connection.

The use of array of objects and how the entire information of objects can be transformed using proper arrays.

Proper use of "try - catch" to find an existing text file (making sure the file exists and is ready to read from it)

Proper use of "BufferedReader - FileReader" to read from an existing text file and parsing the information to use in the defined array of objects


### Technologies Used

1. Abstract classes

2. Extension and implementation

3. interfaces

4. Super() method

5. List<Jet> l = new ArrayList<>();

6. BufferedReader - FileReader

7. try - catch
